<h1>Rules of HEX CARDS <em>beta</em></h1>
<hr>
<h3>Origination:</h3>
<p>HEX cards is poker game I used to play when I was just a kid, so presumably the game was 
originated
at my hometown or the area around. As I remember, the game stayed on top of the poker game 
list for quite a while.
Adults gambled on it, and my dad and sister, we also played a lot, definitely a lot of fun,
 ever lasting
memory, I can still remember how I broke my sister's nose while playing it (Yes we didn't 
gamble money, but 
nose scratching). The memory is extremely sweet when you realize some has gone and some 
become the mother. 
What's more interesting is my girl loves this game even now (I am no longer a fun of poker game),
So there are enough motivations for me to make this game, the beta version only supports 
a few hard-coded logins, no database or whatnot. Basically it's to test all the functionalities 
of both front and back (Don't get me wrong, it's still very playable.).

<h3>How to Six Cards with real cards <em>(Will explain how to play on my incomprehensible UI in 
later section)</em></h3>
<p>You drew 6 cards per round, then divide into, 1, 2, 3 cards, bacsically for three hands of game.
	<ol>
		<li>Single Comparison: rules are simple, Rank(small to big): A,2,3...K.
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suit(stob):Spade, heart,club, diamend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		  Joker equals a spade king</li>
		
		<li>TenHalf: Number cards(as opposed to face cards) equals to their ranks, all face cards
			are considered as a half. The goal of this game is to get a sum as close as ten half 
			and it also has to be smaller than ten half(Very important rule, will be mentioned a
			lot). Joker can be treated as any card for the best interest of this hand(always as 
			a spade).
			<p>what if sums are equal:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sum == 10.5: simply, compare the suit of 10, as always, spade->
				heart->club->diamond. Tie if suit is also the same</li>
				<li>Sum <= 10.0: 
					<ul>
						<li>Combination of two ranks are not the same: (9+1 > 7+3)
						(7+2 > 5+4) (8+2 > 7+3), Hope you could figure out from these 
						examples</li>
						<li>Combination of two ranks are the same: compare the suit of the 
						card with a larger rank. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>Tuo La Ji (Tractor is literal meaning, however this type of comb is called
		straight). 
			<ul>
				<li>Type of card: (Bomb: three are the same), (Straight: three consecutive
				ranks, A,2,3 and Q,K,A included),
				(Flush:not bomb nor straight, all three have the same suit),
				(Pair: not the above three),(high card)</li>
				<li>rule: Bomb > straight > Flush > Pair > high card</li>
				<li>Ace is considered the biggest rank, 2 smallest</li>
				<li>Joker as always can play any card for the best benefit of that hand</li>
				<li>Dive In:
					<ul>
						<li>Bomb: Flushing bomb swallows regular ones regardless of rank,
								for none flushing bombs just compare ranks</li>
						<li>Straight: Flushing ones are winner of regular ones, </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
